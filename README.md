# Austerity and the Citizen

Austerity and the Citizen is a turn-based game that challenges players to explore the effects of austerity
policies in Puerto Rico, both as an individual citizen and as an institution providing services to the public.
Throughout the course of the game, players assume the role of three actors affected by public spending cuts.
&nbsp; &nbsp;
First, as the head of the water authority, players must provide water access and maintenance to the distribution
system, while maintaining the agencyâ€™s finances and protecting the water supply from drought. Second, as the
secretary of the department of health, players must work to keep the healthcare system operating, despite the
increasing emigration of doctors to the mainland US and the threat of federal funding cuts. 
&nbsp; &nbsp;
Finally, as a couple of vulnerable citizens, players must survive , despite the increasing reduction in services provided by the first two actors. Can the citizens survive 5 months of extreme austerity policies? This project is based on actual
institutions, characters and events from the Puerto Rican debt crisis in 2015-2017.
